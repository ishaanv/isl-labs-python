## KNN classifer vs KNN regression methods

A KNN classifer uses labelled data to classify new data.

It does this by calculating the K nearest neighbours. Then cycling through each of the classes we calculate the probability of it being each of those classes. Then the highest probability is choosen.

KNN regression gives the average quantitative value of K nearest values.
